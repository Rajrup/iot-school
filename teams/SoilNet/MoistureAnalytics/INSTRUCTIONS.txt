Hardware:

	Codes are for understanding purposes:

	1. file.py for storing the data from ADC registers to local file in Raspberry Pi.
	
	2. adc_code.c for burning the code for data acquisition from soil sensor to ADC registers.

Software/Analytics:
	
	Step 1: To publish soil moisture from Pi
	
		$ java -cp MoistureAnalytics-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.controller.PublishMoisture2
		(note that sendata file should be present in the base directory which will store sensor data)
	
	Step 2: To subscribe for soil moisture on cloud
	
		$ java -cp MoistureAnalytics-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.controller.SubscribeMoisture
		
		(note: sensordata.txt file contains the received data for 3 minute window and is dynamically updated)
		
	Step 3: running dataAnalysis.m will plot the graph of two sensor data of 3 minute window dynamically in MATLAB
